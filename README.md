# Diabetes_Prediction
My final project for my Machine Learning course which is an SGD logistic regression model implemented using Python. The model predicts whether members of the Pima tribe have diabetes or not using 8 columns/features: pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. Running the test set through the model yielded an accuracy of 75% and an ROC AUC of 0.72.
