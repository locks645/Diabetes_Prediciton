# Diabetes_Prediction
My part for the final project in my Machine Learning course. Implemented an SGD logistic regression model in Python to predict whether members of the Pima tribe had diabetes or not (1 and 0 respectively). The dataset used came from Kaggle's website: [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset/).
